#
#  FORMAT OF THE CONFIGURATION FILE
#  ====================================
#
#  Configuration lines consist of an initial keyword followed by a
#  list of values, all separated by whitespace (any number of spaces
#  or tabs).
#
#  The '#' indicates a comment. Any part of a line following a '#'
#  is ignored, except if the '#' is preceded by a '\'.
#
#  Thus, by placing a # at the start of an existing configuration
#  line, you can make it a comment and it will be treated as if it
#  weren't there. This is called "commenting out" an option and can
#  be useful. Removing the # again is called "uncommenting".
#
#  Note that commenting out an option and leaving it at its default
#  are two completely different things! Most options behave very
#  differently when unset.  See the "Effect if unset" explanation in
#  each option's description for details.
#
#  Long lines can be continued on the next line by using a `\' as the
#  last character.
#
#
#
#  1. LOCAL SET-UP DOCUMENTATION
#  ==============================
#
#  If you intend to operate Seeks for more users than just yourself,
#  it might be a good idea to let them know how to reach you, what
#  you block and why you do that, your policies, etc.
#
#  1.1. user-manual
#  =================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Location of the Seeks User Manual.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      A fully qualified URI
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      http://www.seeks-project.info/0.1/user-manual/ will be used,
#      where version is the Seeks version.
#
#      WARNING!!!
#
#          If set, this option should be the first option in the config
#          file, because it is used while the config file is being read.
#
#user-manual http://www.seeks-project.info/user-manual/
#
#  1.2. admin-address
#  ===================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      An email address to reach the Seeks' proxy administrator.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Email address
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      No email address is displayed on error pages and the CGI user
#      interface.
#
# admin-address seeks-admin@example.com
#
#
#  1.3. proxy-info-url
#  ====================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      A URL to documentation about the local Seeks setup,
#      configuration or policies.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      URL
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      No link to local documentation is displayed on error pages and
#      the CGI user interface.
#
#proxy-info-url http://www.example.com/proxy-service.html
#
#
#  2. CONFIGURATION AND FILE LOCATIONS
#  ========================================
#
#  Seeks can (and normally does) use a number of other files for
#  additional configuration, help and logging. This section of the
#  configuration file tells Seeks where to find those other files.
#
#  The user running Seeks, must have read permission for all
#  configuration files, and write permission to any files that would
#  be modified, such as log files and actions files.
#
#
#
#  2.1. confdir
#  =============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The directory where the other configuration files are located.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Path name
#
#  Default value:
#
#      /etc/seeks (Unix) or Seeks installation dir (Windows)
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Mandatory
#
#  Notes:
#
#      No trailing "/", please.
#
confdir .
#
#
#  2.2. templdir
#  ==============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      An alternative directory where the templates are loaded from.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Path name
#
#  Default value:
#
#      proxy/templates
#
templdir proxy/templates
#
#
#  2.3. logdir
#  ============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The directory where all logging takes place (i.e. where the
#      logfile is located).
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Path name
#
#  Default value:
#
#      /var/log/seeks (Unix) or Seeks installation dir (Windows)
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Mandatory
#
#  Notes:
#
#      No trailing "/", please.
#
logdir .
#
#
#  2.4. logfile
#  =============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The log file to use
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      File name, relative to logdir
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset (commented out). When activated: logfile (Unix) or
#      seeks.log (Windows).
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      No logfile is written.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      The logfile is where all logging and error messages are
#      written. The level of detail and number of messages are set with
#      the debug option (see below).  The logfile can be useful for
#      tracking down a problem with Seeks' proxy and it can help 
#      you to monitor what your browser is doing.
#
#      Depending on the debug options below, the logfile may be a
#      privacy risk if third parties can get access to it. As most
#      users will never look at it.
#
#      For most troubleshooting purposes, you will have to change that,
#      please refer to the debugging section for details.
#
#      Your logfile will grow indefinitely, and you will probably
#      want to periodically remove it. On Unix systems, you can do
#      this with a cron job (see "man cron"). For Red Hat based Linux
#      distributions, a logrotate script has been included.
#
#      Any log files must be writable by whatever user Seeks is
#      being run as.
#
logfile logfile
#
#
# 2.5. plugindir
# ======================
#
# Specifies:
#
#       The repository to be recursively scanned for precompiled plugins.
#
# Type of value:
#
#       Path to a directory.
#
# Default value:
#
#       Unset. Forced through command line or automatically set to base dir.
#
# Notes:
#
#      It makes sense to setup this value after Seeks has been installed 
#      through a package or the configure/make install scripts.
#      
#      The repository is then recursively scanned at startup, and Seeks will
#      try to load _all_ dynamic libraries within this directory.
#      Therefore it is strongly recommended to NOT specify a system-wide 
#      repository such as '/usr/lib' etc...
#
#      Use --plugin-repository your_repository to override the value at startup.
#
# plugindir /usr/local/lib/seeks
#
# 2.6. activated-plugin
# ======================
#
# Specifies:
#
#	The dynamically loaded plugins that are activated.
#
# Type of value:
#      	
#	Plugin name.
#
# Default value:
# 	  
# 	Unset. All loaded plugins are activated.
#
# Notes:
#	
#	Every plugin can define a number of plugin elements,
#	such as URI interceptors and/or filters. Activating/
#	deactivating a plugin means activating/deactivating
#	all of its elements.
#
#	Every plugin name should be unique. For this reason,
#	official plugins will be listed on a dedicated webpage.
#	Loading different plugins with identical names raises
#	a warning. In such case, the plugin that was loaded the
#	last is the one remaining available under that name.
#
activated-plugin websearch
activated-plugin blocker
#activated-plugin no-tracking
activated-plugin img_websearch
activated-plugin uri-capture
activated-plugin query-capture
activated-plugin cf
activated-plugin udb-service
#activated-plugin httpserv
#
#
# 2.7. datadir
# ======================
#
# Specifies:
#
#      The repository in which the machine-independent data are stored.
#
# Type of value:
#
#      Path to a directory.
#
# Default value:
#
#      Unset. Forced through command line or automatically set depending on data.
#
# Notes:
#
#      It makes sense to setup this value after Seeks has been installed
#      through a package or the configure/make install scripts.
#
#      The specified repository should contain data for Seeks and the
#      installed plugins.
# 
#      Use --data-repository your_repository to override the value at startup.
#
# datadir /usr/local/share/seeks
#
#
#  2.8. automatic-proxy-disable
#  ============================
#
# Specifies:
#
#     In case the HTTP server plugin is running, the proxy is automatically
#     disabled.
#
# Type of value:
#
#     0 or 1
#
# Default value:
#
#     1, the proxy is automatically disabled when the HTTP server plugin is
#        running.
#
# automatic-proxy-disable 1
#
#
#  2.9. user-db-file
#  ==================
#
# Specifies:
#
#     Seeks provides a user database for plugins to store data and
#     reuse them (e.g. for web search personalization).
#
# Type of value:
#
#     Path to a file.
#
# Default value:
#
#      Unset. This means the db is located in $HOME/.seeks/seeks_user.db 
#      as default location.
#
# user-db-file /path/to/file.db
#
#  2.10. user-db-address
#  =====================
#
# Specifies:
#
#    Seeks provides the ability to connect to a remote database to store
#    data and reuse them (e.g. for web search personalization).
#
# Type of value:
#
#      [IP-Address]:Port
#
# Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
# Effect if unset:
#
#      Does use a local database.
#
# Example:
#
#      user-db-address 127.0.0.1:9000
#
#  2.11. user-db-startup-check
#  ===========================
#
# Specifies:
#
#    Whether to check the user db at startup for removing old records.
#    On nodes with much content this makes startup slow, so this option
#    allows to deactivate the check at startup.
#
# Type of value:
#
#  0 or 1
#
# Default value: 
#
#    1
#
# user-db-startup-check 1
#
#
#
#  2.12. user-db-optimize
#  ======================
#
# Specifies:
#
#    Whether to optimize the user db at startup and shutdown. Optimization can
#    take a long time on very large databases and thus be detrimental in certain
#    cases. Typically, optimization makes rebooting nodes with large user database
#    a potentially several minutes long operation.
#
# Type of value:
#
#  0 or 1
#
# Default value: 
#
#    1
#
# user-db-optimize 1
#
#
#  2.13. url-source-code
#  ======================
#
# Specifies:
#
#    Sets the URL where the source code of the Seeks node can be read.
#
# Default value:
#
#    http://seeks.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=seeks/seeks;a=tree
#
# url-source-code url/to/source_code
#
#
#  3. DEBUGGING
#  =============
#
#  These options are mainly useful when tracing a problem. Note that
#  you might also want to invoke Seeks with the --no-daemon command
#  line option when debugging.
#
#
#
#  3.1. debug
#  ===========
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Key values that determine what information gets logged.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Integer values
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0 (i.e.: only fatal errors (that cause Seeks to exit) are logged)
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Default value is used (see above).
#
#  Notes:
#
#      The available debug levels are:
#
#        debug         1 # Log the destination for each request Seeks lets through. See also debug 1024.
#        debug         2 # show each connection status
#        debug         4 # show I/O status
#        debug         8 # show header parsing
#        debug        16 # log all data written to the network into the logfile
#        debug        32 # generic debug stream
#        debug        64 # debug regular expression filters
#        debug       128 # debug redirects
#        debug       256 # debug GIF de-animation
#        debug       512 # Common Log Format
#        debug      1024 # Log the destination for requests Seeks didn't let through, and the reason why.
#        debug      2048 # CGI user interface
#        debug      4096 # Startup banner and warnings.
#        debug      8192 # Non-fatal errors
#
#
#      To select multiple debug levels, you can either add them or
#      use multiple debug lines.
#
#      A debug level of 1 is informative because it will show you each
#      request as it happens. 1, 1024, 4096 and 8192 are recommended
#      so that you will notice when things go wrong. The other levels
#      are probably only of interest if you are hunting down a specific
#      problem. They can produce a hell of an output (especially 16).
#
#      Seeks used to ship with the debug levels recommended above
#      enabled by default, but due to privacy concerns 3.0.7 and later
#      are configured to only log fatal errors.
#
#      If you are used to the more verbose settings, simply enable
#      the debug lines below again.
#
#      If you want to use pure CLF (Common Log Format), you should set
#      "debug 512" ONLY and not enable anything else.
#
#      Seeks has a hard-coded limit for the length of log messages. If
#      it's reached, messages are logged truncated and marked with
#      "... [too long, truncated]".
#
#      Please don't file any support requests without trying to
#      reproduce the problem with increased debug level first. Once
#      you read the log messages, you may even be able to solve the
#      problem on your own.
#
debug 1 # Log the destination for each request Seeks let through.
#debug 2
#debug 4
#debug 8
#debug 16
#debug 32
#debug 64
#debug 128
debug 1024 # Log the destination for requests Seeks didn't let through, and the reason why.
#debug 2048
debug 4096 # Startup banner and warnings
debug 8192 # Non-fatal errors
#
#
#  3.2. single-threaded
#  =====================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether to run only one server thread.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      None
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Multi-threaded (or, where unavailable: forked) operation,
#      i.e. the ability to serve multiple requests simultaneously.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      This option is only there for debugging purposes. It will
#      drastically reduce performance.
#
#single-threaded
#
#
#  3.3. hostname
#  ==============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The hostname shown on the CGI pages.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Text
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      The hostname provided by the operating system is used.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      On some misconfigured systems resolving the hostname fails or
#      takes too much time and slows Seeks down. Setting a fixed
#      hostname works around the problem.
#
#      In other circumstances it might be desirable to show a hostname
#      other than the one returned by the operating system. For example
#      if the system has several different hostnames and you don't
#      want to use the first one.
#
#      Note that Seeks does not validate the specified hostname value.
#
#hostname hostname.example.org
#
#
#  4. ACCESS CONTROL AND SECURITY
#  ===============================
#
#  This section of the config file controls the security-relevant
#  aspects of Seeks's configuration.
#
#
#
#  4.1. listen-address
#  ====================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The IP address and TCP port on which Seeks will listen for
#      client requests.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      [IP-Address]:Port
#
#  Default value:
#
#      127.0.0.1:8250
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Bind to 127.0.0.1 (IPv4 localhost), port 8250. This is suitable
#      and recommended for home users who run Seeks on the same
#      machine as their browser.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      You will need to configure your browser(s) to this proxy address
#      and port.
#
#      If you already have another service running on port 8118, or
#      if you want to serve requests from other machines (e.g. on your
#      local network) as well, you will need to override the default.
#
#      IPv6 addresses containing colons have to be quoted by brackets.
#
#      If you leave out the IP address, Seeks will bind to all IPv4
#      interfaces (addresses) on your machine and may become reachable
#      from the Internet. In that case, consider using access control
#      lists (ACL's, see below), and/or a firewall. If the hostname
#      is localhost, Seeks will explicitly try to bind to an IPv4
#      address. For other hostnames it depends on the operating system
#      which IP version will be used.
#
#      If you open Seeks to untrusted users, you will also
#      want to make sure that the following actions are disabled:
#      enable-edit-actions and enable-remote-toggle
#
#  Example:
#
#      Suppose you are running Seeks on a machine which has the
#      address 192.168.0.1 on your local private network (192.168.0.0)
#      and has another outside connection with a different address. You
#      want it to serve requests from inside only:
#
#        listen-address  192.168.0.1:8250
#
#
#      Suppose you are running Seeks on an IPv6-capable machine and
#      you want it to listen on the IPv6 address of the loopback device:
#
#        listen-address [::1]:8250
#
#
listen-address  127.0.0.1:8250
#
#
#  4.2. toggle
#  ============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Initial state of "toggle" status
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      1 or 0
#
#  Default value:
#
#      1
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Act as if toggled on
#
#  Notes:
#
#      If set to 0, Seeks will start in "toggled off" mode,
#      i.e. mostly behave like a normal, content-neutral proxy
#      with both ad blocking and content filtering disabled. See
#      enable-remote-toggle below.
#
#      The windows version will only display the toggle icon in the
#      system tray if this option is present.
#
toggle  1
#
#
#  4.3. enable-remote-toggle
#  ==========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not the web-based toggle feature may be used
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      The web-based toggle feature is disabled.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      When toggled off, Seeks mostly acts like a normal,
#      content-neutral proxy, i.e. doesn't block ads or filter content.
#
#      Access to the toggle feature can not be controlled separately by
#      "ACLs" or HTTP authentication, so that everybody who can access
#      Seeks (see "ACLs" and listen-address above) can toggle it
#      for all users. So this option is not recommended for multi-user
#      environments with untrusted users.
#
#      Note that malicious client side code (e.g Java) is also capable
#      of using this option.
#
#      As a lot of Seeks users don't read documentation, this feature
#      is disabled by default.
#
#      Note that you must have compiled Seeks with support for this
#      feature, otherwise this option has no effect.
#
enable-remote-toggle  0
#
#
#  4.4. enable-remote-http-toggle
#  ===============================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not Seeks recognizes special HTTP headers to change
#      its behaviour.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Seeks ignores special HTTP headers.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      When toggled on, the client can change Seeks's behaviour by
#      setting special HTTP headers. Currently the only supported
#      special header is "X-Filter: No", to disable filtering for
#      the ongoing request, even if it is enabled in one of the
#      action files.
#
#      This feature is disabled by default. If you are using Seeks in
#      a environment with trusted clients, you may enable this feature
#      at your discretion. Note that malicious client side code (e.g
#      Java) is also capable of using this feature.
#
#      This option will be removed in future releases as it has been
#      obsoleted by the more general header taggers.
#
enable-remote-http-toggle  0
#
#
#  4.6. ACLs: permit-access and deny-access
#  =========================================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Who can access what.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      src_addr[:port][/src_masklen] [dst_addr[:port][/dst_masklen]]
#
#      Where src_addr and dst_addr are IPv4 addresses in dotted
#      decimal notation or valid DNS names, port is a port number, and
#      src_masklen and dst_masklen are subnet masks in CIDR notation,
#      i.e. integer values from 2 to 30 representing the length
#      (in bits) of the network address. The masks and the whole
#      destination part are optional.
#
#      If your system implements RFC 3493, then src_addr and dst_addr
#      can be IPv6 addresses delimeted by brackets, port can be a
#      number or a service name, and src_masklen and dst_masklen can
#      be a number from 0 to 128.
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
#      If no port is specified, any port will match. If no src_masklen
#      or src_masklen is given, the complete IP address has to match
#      (i.e. 32 bits for IPv4 and 128 bits for IPv6).
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Don't restrict access further than implied by listen-address
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Access controls are included at the request of ISPs and systems
#      administrators, and are not usually needed by individual
#      users. For a typical home user, it will normally suffice to
#      ensure that Seeks only listens on the localhost (127.0.0.1)
#      or internal (home) network address by means of the listen-address
#      option.
#
#      Please see the warnings in the FAQ that Seeks is not intended
#      to be a substitute for a firewall or to encourage anyone to
#      defer addressing basic security weaknesses.
#
#      Multiple ACL lines are OK. If any ACLs are specified, Seeks
#      only talks to IP addresses that match at least one permit-access
#      line and don't match any subsequent deny-access line. In other
#      words, the last match wins, with the default being deny-access.
#
#      If Seeks is using a forwarder (see forward below) for a
#      particular destination URL, the dst_addr that is examined is
#      the address of the forwarder and NOT the address of the ultimate
#      target. This is necessary because it may be impossible for the
#      local Seeks to determine the IP address of the ultimate target
#      (that's often what gateways are used for).
#
#      You should prefer using IP addresses over DNS names, because
#      the address lookups take time. All DNS names must resolve! You
#      can not use domain patterns like "*.org" or partial domain
#      names. If a DNS name resolves to multiple IP addresses, only
#      the first one is used.
#
#      Some systems allows IPv4 client to connect to IPv6 server
#      socket. Then the client's IPv4 address will be translated by
#      system into IPv6 address space with special prefix ::ffff:0:0/96
#      (so called IPv4 mapped IPv6 address).  Seeks can handle it
#      and maps such ACL addresses automatically.
#
#      Denying access to particular sites by ACL may have undesired
#      side effects if the site in question is hosted on a machine
#      which also hosts other sites (most sites are).
#
#  Examples:
#
#      Explicitly define the default behavior if no ACL and
#      listen-address are set: "localhost" is OK. The absence of a
#      dst_addr implies that all destination addresses are OK:
#
#        permit-access  localhost
#
#
#      Allow any host on the same class C subnet as www.seeks-project.info
#      access to nothing but www.example.com (or other domains hosted
#      on the same system):
#
#        permit-access  www.seeks-project.info/24 www.example.com/32
#
#
#      Allow access from any host on the 26-bit subnet 192.168.45.64 to
#      anywhere, with the exception that 192.168.45.73 may not access
#      the IP address behind www.dirty-stuff.example.com:
#
#        permit-access  192.168.45.64/26 
#        deny-access   192.168.45.73  www.dirty-stuff.example.com
#
#      Allow access from the IPv4 network 192.0.2.0/24 even if listening
#      on an IPv6 wild card address (not supported on all platforms):
#
#        permit-access  192.0.2.0/24
#
#
#      This is equivalent to the following line even if listening on
#      an IPv4 address (not supported on all platforms):
#
#        permit-access  [::ffff:192.0.2.0]/120
#
#
#  4.7. buffer-limit
#  ==================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Maximum size of the buffer for content filtering.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Size in Kbytes
#
#  Default value:
#
#      4096
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Use a 4MB (4096 KB) limit.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      When a document buffer size reaches the buffer-limit, it is
#      flushed to the client unfiltered and no further attempt to filter
#      the rest of the document is made. Remember that there may be
#      multiple threads running, which might require up to buffer-limit
#      Kbytes each, unless you have enabled "single-threaded" above.
#
buffer-limit 4096
#
#
#  5. FORWARDING
#  ==============
#
#  This feature allows routing of HTTP requests through a chain of
#  multiple proxies.
#
#  Forwarding can be used to chain Seeks with a caching proxy to
#  speed up browsing. Using a parent proxy may also be necessary if
#  the machine that Seeks runs on has no direct Internet access.
#
#  Note that parent proxies can severely decrease your privacy
#  level. For example a parent proxy could add your IP address to the
#  request headers and if it's a caching proxy it may add the "Etag"
#  header to revalidation requests again, even though you configured
#  Seeks to remove it. It may also ignore Seeks's header time
#  randomization and use the original values which could be used by
#  the server as cookie replacement to track your steps between visits.
#
#  Also specified here are SOCKS proxies. Seeks supports the SOCKS
#  4 and SOCKS 4A protocols.
#
#
#
#  5.1. forward
#  =============
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      To which parent HTTP proxy specific requests should be routed.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      target_pattern http_parent[:port]
#
#      where target_pattern is a URL pattern that specifies to which
#      requests (i.e. URLs) this forward rule shall apply. Use /
#      to denote "all URLs".  http_parent[:port] is the DNS name or
#      IP address of the parent HTTP proxy through which the requests
#      should be forwarded, optionally followed by its listening port
#      (default: 8000). Use a single dot (.) to denote "no forwarding".
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Don't use parent HTTP proxies.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      If http_parent is ".", then requests are not forwarded to
#      another HTTP proxy but are made directly to the web servers.
#
#      http_parent can be a numerical IPv6 address (if RFC 3493 is
#      implemented).  To prevent clashes with the port delimiter,
#      the whole IP address has to be put into brackets. On the other
#      hand a target_pattern containing an IPv6 address has to be put
#      into angle brackets (normal brackets are reserved for regular
#      expressions already).
#
#      Multiple lines are OK, they are checked in sequence, and the
#      last match wins.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      Everything goes to an example parent proxy, except SSL on port
#      443 (which it doesn't handle):
#
#        forward   /      parent-proxy.example.org:8080 
#        forward   :443   .
#
#
#      Everything goes to our example ISP's caching proxy, except for
#      requests to that ISP's sites:
#
#        forward   /                  caching-proxy.isp.example.net:8000
#        forward   .isp.example.net   .
#
#
#      Parent proxy specified by an IPv6 address:
#
#        foward   /                   [2001:DB8::1]:8000
#
#
#      Suppose your parent proxy doesn't support IPv6:
#
#        forward  /                        parent-proxy.example.org:8000
#        forward  ipv6-server.example.org  .
#        forward  <[2-3][0-9a-f][0-9a-f][0-9a-f]:*>   .
#
#
#  5.2. forward-socks4, forward-socks4a and forward-socks5
#  ========================================================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Through which SOCKS proxy (and optionally to which parent HTTP
#      proxy) specific requests should be routed.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      target_pattern socks_proxy[:port] http_parent[:port]
#
#      where target_pattern is a URL pattern that specifies to which
#      requests (i.e. URLs) this forward rule shall apply. Use / to
#      denote "all URLs".  http_parent and socks_proxy are IP addresses
#      in dotted decimal notation or valid DNS names (http_parent may
#      be "." to denote "no HTTP forwarding"), and the optional port
#      parameters are TCP ports, i.e. integer values from 1 to 65535
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Don't use SOCKS proxies.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Multiple lines are OK, they are checked in sequence, and the
#      last match wins.
#
#      The difference between forward-socks4 and forward-socks4a
#      is that in the SOCKS 4A protocol, the DNS resolution of the
#      target hostname happens on the SOCKS server, while in SOCKS 4
#      it happens locally.
#
#      With forward-socks5 the DNS resolution will happen on the remote
#      server as well.
#
#      socks_proxy and http_parent can be a numerical IPv6 address
#      (if RFC 3493 is implemented). To prevent clashes with the port
#      delimiter, the whole IP address has to be put into brackets. On
#      the other hand a target_pattern containing an IPv6 address has
#      to be put into angle brackets (normal brackets are reserved
#      for regular expressions already).
#
#      If http_parent is ".", then requests are not forwarded to another
#      HTTP proxy but are made (HTTP-wise) directly to the web servers,
#      albeit through a SOCKS proxy.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      From the company example.com, direct connections are made to all
#      "internal" domains, but everything outbound goes through their
#      ISP's proxy by way of example.com's corporate SOCKS 4A gateway
#      to the Internet.
#
#        forward-socks4a   /       socks-gw.example.com:1080    www-cache.isp.example.net:8080 
#        forward           .example.com        .
#
#
#      A rule that uses a SOCKS 4 gateway for all destinations but no
#      HTTP parent looks like this:
#
#        forward-socks4   /               socks-gw.example.com:1080  .
#
#
#      To chain Seeks and Tor, both running on the same system,
#      you would use something like:
#
#        forward-socks5   /               127.0.0.1:9050 .
#
#
#      The public Tor network can't be used to reach your local network,
#      if you need to access local servers you therefore might want
#      to make some exceptions:
#
#        forward         192.168.*.*/     .  
#        forward         10.*.*.*/        .  
#        forward         127.*.*.*/       .
#
#
#      Unencrypted connections to systems in these address ranges will
#      be as (un) secure as the local network is, but the alternative
#      is that you can't reach the local network through Seeks at
#      all. Of course this may actually be desired and there is no
#      reason to make these exceptions if you aren't sure you need them.
#
#      If you also want to be able to reach servers in your local
#      network by using their names, you will need additional exceptions
#      that look like this:
#
#       forward           localhost/     .
#
#
#  5.3. forwarded-connect-retries
#  ===============================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      How often Seeks retries if a forwarded connection request
#      fails.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Number of retries.
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Connections forwarded through other proxies are treated like
#      direct connections and no retry attempts are made.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      forwarded-connect-retries is mainly interesting for socks4a
#      connections, where Seeks can't detect why the connections
#      failed. The connection might have failed because of a DNS timeout
#      in which case a retry makes sense, but it might also have failed
#      because the server doesn't exist or isn't reachable. In this
#      case the retry will just delay the appearance of Seeks's
#      error message.
#
#      Note that in the context of this option, "forwarded connections"
#      includes all connections that Seeks forwards through other
#      proxies. This option is not limited to the HTTP CONNECT method.
#
#      Only use this option, if you are getting lots of
#      forwarding-related error messages that go away when you try again
#      manually. Start with a small value and check Seeks's logfile
#      from time to time, to see how many retries are usually needed.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      forwarded-connect-retries 1
#
forwarded-connect-retries  0
#
#
#  6. MISCELLANEOUS
#  =================
#
#  6.1. accept-intercepted-requests
#  =================================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether intercepted requests should be treated as valid.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Only proxy requests are accepted, intercepted requests are
#      treated as invalid.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      If you don't trust your clients and want to force them to use
#      Seeks, enable this option and configure your packet filter
#      to redirect outgoing HTTP connections into Seeks.
#
#      Make sure that Seeks's own requests aren't redirected as well.
#      Additionally take care that Seeks can't intentionally connect
#      to itself, otherwise you could run into redirection loops if
#      Seeks's listening port is reachable by the outside or an
#      attacker has access to the pages you visit.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      accept-intercepted-requests 1
#
accept-intercepted-requests 1
#
#
#  6.2. allow-cgi-request-crunching
#  =================================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether requests to Seeks's CGI pages can be blocked or
#      redirected.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Seeks ignores block and redirect actions for its CGI pages.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      By default Seeks ignores block or redirect actions for
#      its CGI pages.  Intercepting these requests can be useful in
#      multi-user setups to implement fine-grained access control,
#      but it can also render the complete web interface useless and
#      make debugging problems painful if done without care.
#
#      Don't enable this option unless you're sure that you really
#      need it.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      allow-cgi-request-crunching 1
#
allow-cgi-request-crunching 0
#
#
#  6.3. split-large-cgi-forms
#  =======================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether the CGI interface should stay compatible with broken
#      HTTP clients.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      0
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      The CGI form generate long GET URLs.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Seeks's CGI forms can lead to rather long URLs. This isn't
#      a problem as far as the HTTP standard is concerned, but it can
#      confuse clients with arbitrary URL length limitations.
#
#      Enabling split-large-cgi-forms causes Seeks to divide big forms
#      into smaller ones to keep the URL length down. It makes editing
#      a lot less convenient and you can no longer submit all changes
#      at once, but at least it works around this browser bug.
#
#      If you don't notice any editing problems, there is no reason
#      to enable this option, but if one of the submit buttons appears
#      to be broken, you should give it a try.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      split-large-cgi-forms 1
#
split-large-cgi-forms 0
#
#
#  6.4. keep-alive-timeout
#  ========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Number of seconds after which an open connection will no longer
#      be reused.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Time in seconds.
#
#  Default value:
#
#      None
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Connections are not kept alive.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      This option allows clients to keep the connection to Seeks
#      alive. If the server supports it, Seeks will keep the
#      connection to the server alive as well. Under certain
#      circumstances this may result in speed-ups.
#
#      By default, Seeks will close the connection to the server if
#      the client connection gets closed, or if the specified timeout
#      has been reached without a new request coming in. This behaviour
#      can be changed with the connection-sharing option.
#
#      This option has no effect if Seeks has been compiled without
#      keep-alive support.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      keep-alive-timeout 300
#
#keep-alive-timeout 300
#
#
#  6.5. connection-sharing
#  ========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not outgoing connections that have been kept alive
#      should be shared between different incoming connections.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      0 or 1
#
#  Default value:
#
#      None
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Connections are not shared.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      This option has no effect if Seeks has been compiled without
#      keep-alive support, or if it's disabled.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Note that reusing connections doesn't necessary cause
#      speedups. There are also a few privacy implications you should
#      be aware of.
#
#      If this option is effective, outgoing connections are shared
#      between clients (if there are more than one) and closing the
#      browser that initiated the outgoing connection does no longer
#      affect the connection between Seeks and the server unless
#      the client's request hasn't been completed yet.
#
#      If the outgoing connection is idle, it will not be closed until
#      either Seeks's or the server's timeout is reached. While
#      it's open, the server knows that the system running Seeks is
#      still there.
#
#      If there are more than one client (maybe even belonging to
#      multiple users), they will be able to reuse each others
#      connections. This is potentially dangerous in case of
#      authentication schemes like NTLM where only the connection
#      is authenticated, instead of requiring authentication for
#      each request.
#
#      If there is only a single client, and if said client can keep
#      connections alive on its own, enabling this option has next to
#      no effect. If the client doesn't support connection keep-alive,
#      enabling this option may make sense as it allows Seeks to keep
#      outgoing connections alive even if the client itself doesn't
#      support it.
#
#      You should also be aware that enabling this option increases
#      the likelihood of getting the "No server or forwarder data"
#      error message, especially if you are using a slow connection
#      to the Internet.
#
#      This option should only be used by experienced users who
#      understand the risks and can weight them against the benefits.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      connection-sharing 1
#
#connection-sharing 1
#
#
#  6.6. socket-timeout
#  ====================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Number of seconds after which a socket times out if no data
#      is received.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Time in seconds.
#
#  Default value:
#
#      None
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      A default value of 300 seconds is used.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      For SOCKS requests the timeout currently doesn't start until
#      the SOCKS server accepted the request. This will be fixed in
#      the next release.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      socket-timeout 300
#
socket-timeout 300
#
#
#  6.7. max-client-connections
#  ============================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Maximum number of client connections that will be served.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Positive number.
#
#  Default value:
#
#      None
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Connections are served until a resource limit is reached.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Seeks creates one thread (or process) for every incoming
#      client connection that isn't rejected based on the access
#      control settings.
#
#      If the system is powerful enough, Seeks can theoretically deal
#      with several hundred (or thousand) connections at the same time,
#      but some operating systems enforce resource limits by shutting
#      down offending processes and their default limits may be below
#      the ones Seeks would require under heavy load.
#
#      Configuring Seeks to enforce a connection limit below the
#      thread or process limit used by the operating system makes
#      sure this doesn't happen.  Simply increasing the operating
#      system's limit would work too, but if Seeks isn't the only
#      application running on the system, you may actually want to
#      limit the resources used by Seeks.
#
#      If Seeks is only used by a single trusted user, limiting the
#      number of client connections is probably unnecessary. If there
#      are multiple possibly untrusted users you probably still want
#      to additionally use a packet filter to limit the maximal number
#      of incoming connections per client. Otherwise a malicious user
#      could intentionally create a high number of connections to
#      prevent other users from using Seeks.
#
#      Obviously using this option only makes sense if you choose a
#      limit below the one enforced by the operating system.
#
#  Examples:
#
#      max-client-connections 256
#
max-client-connections 256
#
#
#  7. WINDOWS GUI OPTIONS
#  =======================
#
#  Seeks has a number of options specific to the Windows GUI
#  interface:
#
#
#  If "activity-animation" is set to 1, the Seeks icon will animate
#  when "Seeks" is active. To turn off, set to 0.
#
#activity-animation   1
#
#  If "log-messages" is set to 1, Seeks will log messages to the
#  console window:
#
#log-messages   1
#
#  If "log-buffer-size" is set to 1, the size of the log buffer,
#  i.e. the amount of memory used for the log messages displayed in
#  the console window, will be limited to "log-max-lines" (see below).
#
#  Warning: Setting this to 0 will result in the buffer to grow
#  infinitely and eat up all your memory!
#
#log-buffer-size 1
#
#  log-max-lines is the maximum number of lines held in the log
#  buffer. See above.
#
#log-max-lines 200
#
#  If "log-highlight-messages" is set to 1, Seeks will highlight
#  portions of the log messages with a bold-faced font:
#
#log-highlight-messages 1
#
#  The font used in the console window:
